AGU Computer Society is a meritocratic, consensus-based community. Anyone with an interest in a project related to computer science can join the community, contribute to a project design and participate in the decision-making process. It started its life as an independent society in 2017 but now it is a student club at Abdullah GÃ¼l University.
